Heuristic Changes
=================

Consistency and Standards
-------------------------
I want to make sure my site meets consistency and standard expectations. I am wanting to do this because it makes the site easier for users to use and they will have less 
confusion when navigating around the website. For example, I will be putting my navigation links at the top of my site because that is one of the expected places for 
navigation links and it is easy to find.

Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design
---------------------------------
I want to keep my site very minimal in the design aspect. I want it to be straight to the point and not a lot going on because, like for the consistency and standards,
it makes it easier for the users to see and locate things on the website. Some people that are color blind or visually impaired may have a hard time finding certain 
things that they would like to click on. For example, I will only be using Red and Black for my website colors. I am using red because the API I am using is based off of
the 'Red List of Threatened Species' which I thought if I used red, it would be fitting. Otherwise, the user will not be missing out on differing imagery on the site
if they are visually impaired.


Increase or Decrease Usability?
===============================
I would like to increase my usability for my website. Currently, it is not very user friendly because I still have a lot of things to fix. For example, my routes, my css,
executing my website layout, and the database all have issues that need to be fixed. My goal is to have it at a basic user-friendly level by the time I submit my final
project.
